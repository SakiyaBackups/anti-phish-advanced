# Anti-Phish Advanced

This is the advanced version of the [Anti-Phishing Implementation](https://github.com/SakiyaDev/anti-phish-implementation) library. Made to cater to the advanced developer population who might want to handle phishers differently than the implementation library. 


## Installation

```
npm i anti-phish-advanced
```

## Usage

```js
const { Client, version } = require('discord.js');
const { Fish } = require('anti-phish-advanced'); //fancy imports
const client = new Client({ intents: ['GUILD_MESSAGES', 'GUILDS',] }); //create client, requires guild and guild messages to function.
const fish = new Fish(); //create fish

client.on("phishingMessage", (message, data) => {
    console.log(message, data); //"message" is the Message object containing the link, and "data" is the data returned by the api

    message.channel.send(`Phishing link detected by ${message.author}. Clicking this link may put your account at risk.`);
});

fish.init(client, version); //initialize fishing client, DO THIS BEFORE YOU LOGIN. Pass version if you would like, default is the latest djs version.
client.login('TOKEN'); //login to discord.
```

## Extra

This library was made to cater to more of the advanced developers.
